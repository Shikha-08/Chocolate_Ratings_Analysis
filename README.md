## **Overview**
A data-driven analysis of chocolate ratings, exploring the impact of cocoa percentage, bean origin, and industry trends to uncover key factors influencing chocolate quality.

## **Dataset**
This project is based on a dataset that includes chocolate bar reviews from various manufacturers worldwide. It contains details such as:
- **Cocoa Percentage**
- **Chocolate Ratings**
- **Bean Origins**
- **Company Locations**
- **Review Year**

## **Objectives**
✅ Identify the relationship between cocoa percentage and ratings
✅ Explore how bean origins influence chocolate quality  
✅ Analyze trends in chocolate ratings over time  
✅ Provide insights for manufacturers, marketers, and consumers  

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**
The dataset was cleaned and analyzed using Tableau to generate interactive visualizations. Key analyses include:
- Scatter plots for cocoa percentage vs. ratings
- Bar charts for average ratings by bean origin
- A heatmap to reveal density-based patterns

## **Key Findings**
📌 **Cocoa Percentage vs. Rating**  
- Chocolates with 85%+ cocoa do not always receive higher ratings.  
- The 60-80% cocoa range tends to have the best ratings.  

📌 **Bean Origin & Ratings**  
- Chocolates made from Bali, Brazil, and Tobago beans received the highest ratings.  
- Bean origin significantly affects chocolate quality.  

📌 **Trends Over Time**  
- Ratings have remained relatively stable, with a slight dip in 2008.
